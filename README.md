## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- ⚛️ **React.js**  
- 📜 **JavaScript (ES6+)**  
- 🧩 **React Hooks**  
  - `useState` → manage input values  
  - `useRef` → access DOM elements directly  
- 🎨 **CSS** → for styling & basic responsiveness  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations  
- 🔄 Tasks are **not persistent** — refreshing the page clears the list.  
- 🛑 Relies on **direct DOM manipulation** instead of React’s declarative rendering.  
- 🎭 **Minimal styling** — no animations or advanced UI/UX.  
- 📅 **No categories, deadlines, or priorities** for tasks.  
- 📦 **Not optimized** for large-scale or production use.
